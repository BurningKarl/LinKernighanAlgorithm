# LinKernighanAlgorithm
My implementation of the Lin-Kernighan-algorithm as described in Combinatorial optimization by Korte and Vygen with improvements by Keld Helsgaun as part of a course at the Uni Bonn

## Usage

1. Compile the program to `LinKernighanAlgorithm`
1. Run `LinKernighanAlgorithm tsplib_problem.tsp [tsplib_problem.opt.tour] | python3 visualize.py`
1. See how the algorithm gradually improves a tour, until no additional exchanges with positive gain are found
